# Comments Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a modern, GitHub-like conversation UI for ticket comments with full API integration.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. **CommentsList Component** (`src/components/CommentsList.tsx`)
- Displays comments in a clean, card-based conversation UI
- Features:
  - User avatars with role badges
  - Relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago", "just now")
  - Responsive layout with proper mobile support
  - Loading skeletons for better UX
  - Empty state messaging
  - Automatic author details fetching

### 2. **CommentForm Component** (`src/components/forms/CommentForm.tsx`)
- Modern comment input with GitHub-like styling
- Features:
  - Clean textarea with focus states
  - File attachment support with visual feedback
  - Keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + Enter to submit
  - Loading states during submission
  - Markdown support indicator
  - Responsive button layout

### 3. **TicketCreateForm** (Updated)
- Integrated comments section that appears after ticket creation
- Workflow:
  1. User creates ticket
  2. Comments section becomes available immediately
  3. Can add comments without leaving the form
  4. Real-time comment list updates

### 4. **TicketEditForm** (Updated)
- Full comments integration for existing tickets
- Shows conversation history
- Add new comments inline
- Auto-refresh on new comment submission

### 5. **Dialog Component** (Updated)
- Made dialogs responsive and scrollable
- Features:
  - Responsive width: `w-[calc(100%-1rem)]` on mobile, wider on desktop
  - Responsive height: `max-h-[95vh]` mobile to `max-h-[85vh]` desktop
  - Scrollable content area with proper overflow handling
  - Responsive padding: smaller on mobile (p-4), larger on desktop (p-6)
  - Close button always visible
  - Proper flexbox layout to prevent vertical stretching

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /tickets/:ticketId/comments` - List comments for a ticket
- `POST /comments` - Create a new comment
- `POST /attachments/upload` - Upload file attachments
- `GET /users` - Fetch user details for comment authors

### Data Flow
1. **Load Comments**: Fetches comments with `listByTicket(ticketId)`
2. **Enrich Data**: Fetches author details and maps to comments
3. **Display**: Renders with avatars, roles, and timestamps
4. **Create**: Posts new comments with `create({ticketId, bodyMd})`
5. **Refresh**: Updates list via refresh trigger state

## UI/UX Features

### Modern Design
- Card-based comment layout
- Proper spacing and typography
- Hover states and transitions
- Muted colors for secondary information
- Role badges (Admin, Employee, Client)

### Responsive Behavior
- Mobile-first design
- Stacked layout on small screens
- Optimized touch targets
- Proper text wrapping and overflow handling

### User Feedback
- Loading skeletons during fetch
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Toast notifications on success/error
- Disabled states for forms
- Visual feedback for file attachments

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Focus management

## Usage Examples

### In TicketCreateForm
```tsx
<TicketCreateForm 
  clientId="client-123"
  projectId="project-456"
  onSuccess={() => console.log('Created')}
/>
```

### In TicketEditForm
```tsx
<TicketEditForm 
  ticketId="ticket-789"
  role="ADMIN"
  onSaved={(ticket) => console.log(ticket)}
/>
```

### Standalone Comments
```tsx
<CommentsList ticketId="ticket-123" refreshTrigger={refreshCount} />
<CommentForm ticketId="ticket-123" onPosted={() => setRefreshCount(c => c + 1)} />
```

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Refresh trigger pattern for comment updates
- Optimistic UI updates where possible

### Performance
- Memoized computations where appropriate
- Efficient re-renders with proper dependencies
- Lazy loading of author details

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback UI for missing data
- Console logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Markdown Rendering**: Parse and display markdown in comments
2. **Edit/Delete Comments**: Allow users to modify their comments
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live comments
4. **Reactions**: Add emoji reactions to comments
5. **Mentions**: @mention functionality for users
6. **Attachments Preview**: Show image previews inline
7. **Comment Threads**: Nested reply support
8. **Pagination**: For tickets with many comments
9. **Search**: Find specific comments
10. **Notifications**: Alert users of new comments
